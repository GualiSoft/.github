# GualiSoft by @Gualidan
GualiSoft is a suite of tools developed around linux and open-source that complement each other while still being modular they are focused on performance ease of use and eye candy.  

# Who we target 
As users we target Developers that want a fast and efficient workflow without the pressure that a company could take it from them. All our software is licensed under the GPL 3.0 ensuring this software always stays free and open source and that no company or individual could redistribute it as a closed source product and maje profit of the work of volunteers. 

# Our phylosophy
We belive that everything should not be a chrome skin. Software should be if possible always built in "proper" programming languages to prioritise performance over ease of development. That's why unless absolutely nescessary we will not build desktop applications using web technologies and we will prioritise low-level highly performant languages. 

# What we deliver 
We deliver highly performant software designed for Developers and __Linux__ users that need an open suite of tools to use in their daily workflow we hope you will enjoy

# Disclaimer 
For now all of tools are in very early WIP and are not usable we will deliver as fast as possible. 

# Community 
We are of course open to community contribution. 

All our projects can be discussed in this Fluxer Community: https://fluxer.gg/SP6of74I
